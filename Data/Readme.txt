Tacent View (this tool) and Tacent are licenced by me (Tristan Grimmer) under the ISC licence. This licence is similar to MIT but without the verbiage.

The various SDKs contain their own licence files in Tacent/Contrib/SDKName
The icons are from https://ionicons.com/ and are MIT licensed. See Licence_IonIcons_MIT.txt
The font is from https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/apache/roboto and is licenced under Apache 2. See Licence_RobotoFont_Apache2.txt
This product includes Radiance software (http://radsite.lbl.gov/) developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (http://www.lbl.gov/).
This product uses OpenEXR source code for reading high-dynamic-range EXR files.
This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
Various image formats including exr use the Zlib compression (and decompression) library.

Thank you all :)
