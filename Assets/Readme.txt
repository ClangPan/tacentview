Tacent View (this tool) and Tacent are licenced by me (Tristan Grimmer) under the ISC licence. This licence is similar to MIT but without the verbiage.

3rd-party SDKs contain their own licences and conditions. For licences used by Tacent see Licence*.txt in the Tacent/Docs directory. The licences for TacentView are a superset of the Tacent licences and are found in the Data directory.

Thank you to github users Frousties and Oddwarg for providing suggestions/fixes.
