# tacit-texview
A texture viewer for tga, jpg, png, tiff, dds etc. Uses Dear IMGUI, OpenGL, and the Tacent library. This viewer is useful for game devs as it displays important information like the presence of an alpha channel and querying specific pixels for their colour.

This tool is a work in progress. It only just gained the ability to load and display textures.
