# tacit-texview
A texture viewer for tga, jpg, png, tiff, dds etc. Uses Dear IMGUI, OpenGL, and the Tacent library. This viewer is (will be) useful for game devs as it displays important information like the presence of an alpha channel and querying specific pixels for their colour.

You cannot view dds files quite yet, but it is becoming close to useful. Left/right direction keys load previous and next images, semitransparent images are displayed with a checkerboard background, and you can convert any image to a tga.
