## Introduction

_Tacent View_ is both fast and correct. Most of the image loading code is either custom or
based on official reference implementations. Once decoded, images are marshalled to GPU memory for
fast switching/rendering. The thumbnail viewer caches images and meta-data and is able to handle
thousands of files in a single directory at interactive speeds.

_Tacent View_ is distributed in 
1. As **source code** that may be compiled locally.
2. As a pre-compiled **portable application** for Windows (64-bit)
3. As a Linux **deb** file.
4. As a Snapcraft **snap**.
